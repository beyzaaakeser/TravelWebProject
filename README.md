<h1>Travel Website</h1>

I am here with a responsive travel discovery site designed with the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, animated with scrollReveal. A visually impressive travel site with smooth transitions thanks to the ScrollReveal library. It works responsively according to different screen sizes. It guides you to discover unique beauties around the world.
